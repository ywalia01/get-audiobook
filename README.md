# Free Audiobook Downloader

A simple python script I wrote for automating downloading audiobooks from a legit site ;)

## Steps to follow:

1. Enter the links for the audiobooks that you want downloaded into the [tasks.txt](/tasks.txt) file

2. Edit the directory name variable in [main.py](/main.py) to fit your requirements

3. Simply run the [main.py](/main.py) file and you're good to go!
